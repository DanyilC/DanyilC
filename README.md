### Hey, My name is Danyil Chebotaiev! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student at IUPUI striving towards a career of a software developer. I'm currently based in Noblesville, Indiana.

I've been interested in programming since I got my first PC back in 2009, just when I got into third grade. It all began when I decided to create and host my own Minecraft server with custom plugins for me and my friends to play on at that time. That got me into learning and developing many new skills that allowed me to create my own stuff or build new things on the foundation created by others. 

### What I'm currently working on

I'm currently working on improving my Java skills.
